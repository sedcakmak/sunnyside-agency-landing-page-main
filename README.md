### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I built the hamburger menu from scratch without copy-pasting and modifying others' codes. I also became more comfortable in using grids.

### Continued development

I would like to improve my skills in building responsive websites. Even though I constantly refactored my code, I still believe that the media queries section should be shorter.

I ran into two bugs in Chrome which I couldn't find a solution for:

The font-sizes doesn't reflect the actual value. Also, the SVG for the social media icons sometimes doesn't show up.

Both of these work on localhost Chrome and Chrome mobile as expected, but works arbitrarily on live site desktop Chrome. (It works on Safari and Microsoft Edge)
